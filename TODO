to program:
done - fix coverage around indels
done - schmutzi.pl wrapper
done add 5bp away from indel for mtCont
done- Add deamination from contaminant
try to fix bug on laptop where it crashes.


read data:
- check Denisovans from Susanna
- run cont check
- what was Matthias' criteria for diag. pos ?

Take Denisova genome and check reads that span:
- take sites where nean+denis+chimp share, all 1000G derived
- take sites where nean+denis share, all 1000G all ancestral
- check for length difference
- do a mixture model fit and estimate endo deamination based on that ?


simulations:
- do it once with double strand
- We have neandertal, Ust-Ishim and do Denisova
- make all latex figures
